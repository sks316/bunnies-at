A bunnyposting bot for AT Protocol! Posts bunnies to Bluesky every hour.

## Running the bot

First, clone the bot. Then, install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now make a new file named `config.py` in the bot's directory. Paste the following:

```
username = "YOUR-USERNAME-HERE"
password = "YOUR-APP-PASSWORD-HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME-HERE` with your account's username. Now go to the App Password section of your account settings and generate a new app password, and replace `YOUR-APP-PASSWORD-HERE` with it. Run the bot and you'll be posting cute buns every hour!
